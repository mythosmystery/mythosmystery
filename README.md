### Hi there, welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

### About Me  
  
My name is Hunter Barton and I am a 24 year old software developer. I gained a love of programming and computers from a young age by watching my dad, who was also a professional programmer. While I didn't understand much at first, it stuck with me and I have picked up many cool skills in my time as a developer. I started by learning Java at Pima Community College in Tucson, AZ. I took a bit of a break from programming to focus on my career at the time, which was electronics repair. While I may not have been programming, the logical thinking and troubleshooting skills I learned there have been invaluable as a developer. Thanks to COVID I ended up with a lot of time on my hands and I decided I wanted to better myself and learn a new skill... web development! I attended a 6 month long full-stack web development bootcamp ran by Georgia Tech University. I learned many things there such as: Javascript, MongoDB, React, Express, and GraphQL. After that I started working on my own projects and learned many new skills and tools like Typescript, PostgreSQL, NextJS, and Remix. I was able to use these skills to land a position as a developer at WPA Intelligence working on our data platform called Bonfire. I have learned even more cool new things and met so many amazing people in my time at WPA so far. I have learned many skills that I will carry with me forever like Rust, Vue, and Docker. 

### What I'm Working On

* Rust development
* Svelte and Sveltekit
* Yew Webassembly
* Improving at design

### My Favorite Things

1. Rust. It combines the speed of C with the readability of Typescript, and the safety of a garbage collected language. I absolutely love writing Rust code. The ecosystem is great, with many well thought out libraries and a fantastic community.
  
2. Typescript. Basically, this is what Javascript should have been. It lends itself to much clearer and more readable code thanks to its strong typing. I love it because it is able to utilize the masses of great Javascript libraries, while providing the modern features and intellisense I've come to expect.
  
3. Svelte. Especially when used with Sveltekit, it provides an extremely easy to write syntax and the power of a metaframework like NextJS. I love how easy it is to build anything from static websites to complex webapps using Svelte.
  
*Honorable Mentions*  
   Vue2. I personally love Vue2 and greatly prefer it over Vue3. I find the option API to be an extremely intuitive way of handling reactivity, and Vuex with Vuex-pathify is a simply amazing way of handling global state in an application.
