## About Me  
  
My name is Hunter Barton and I am a 24 year old software developer. I gained a love of programming and computers from a young age by watching my dad, who was also a professional programmer. While I didn't understand much at first, it stuck with me and I have picked up many cool skills in my time as a developer. I started by learning Java at Pima Community College in Tucson, AZ. I took a bit of a break from programming to focus on my career at the time, which was electronics repair. While I may not have been programming, the logical thinking and troubleshooting skills I learned there have been invaluable as a developer. Thanks to COVID I ended up with a lot of time on my hands and I decided I wanted to better myself and learn a new skill... web development! I attended a 6 month long full-stack web development bootcamp ran by Georgia Tech University. I learned many things there such as: Javascript, MongoDB, React, Express, and GraphQL. After that I started working on my own projects and learned many new skills and tools like Typescript, PostgreSQL, NextJS, and Remix. I was able to use these skills to land a position as a developer at WPA Intelligence working on our data platform called Bonfire. I have learned even more cool new things and met so many amazing people in my time at WPA so far. I have learned many skills that I will carry with me forever like Rust, Golang, Vue, and Docker.
