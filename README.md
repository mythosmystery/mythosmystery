### Hi there! Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

### About Me  
  
My name is Hunter Barton and I am a 26 year old software developer. I gained a love of programming and computers from a young age by watching my dad, who was also a professional programmer. While I didn't understand much at first, it stuck with me and I have picked up many cool skills in my time as a developer. I started by learning Java at Pima Community College in Tucson, AZ. I took a bit of a break from programming to focus on my career at the time, which was electronics repair. While I may not have been programming, the logical thinking and troubleshooting skills I learned there have been invaluable as a developer. Thanks to COVID I ended up with a lot of time on my hands and I decided I wanted to better myself and learn a new skill... web development! I attended a 6 month long full-stack web development bootcamp ran by Georgia Tech University. I learned many things there such as: Javascript, MongoDB, React, Express, and GraphQL. After that I started working on my own projects and learned many new skills and tools like Typescript, PostgreSQL, NextJS, and Remix. I was able to use these skills to land a position as a developer at WPA Intelligence working on a data platform called Bonfire. I learned even more cool new things and met so many amazing people in my time at WPA. 

### What I'm Working On

* C++/C Development
* Data structures and algorithms
* Memory management
* Design patterns
   
### My Setup 

**Operating System**  
I use all three major operating systems. My favorite is Linux, particularly Debian and Arch. I have been using Windows for an extremely long time but I'm not a big fan of it for development. 
<br />
**Code Editor**  
I primarily use Neovim, but I also use the Jetbrains suite for certain things
<br />  
**CLI Applications**  
* Bat - A modern replacement for Cat with line numbers and syntax highlighting
* TMUX - An extremely powerful terminal multiplexer that allows you to have multiple panes and windows open, and to save session for later access.
* Exa - A replacement for ls with many more features and great syntax highlighting
* Z - The fastest way to jump between different frequently used directories.
* NVM - Install and switch between any version of Node.js
